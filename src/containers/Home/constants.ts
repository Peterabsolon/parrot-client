Good morning, counsel. [FOOBAR] Good morning, your Honor. Very briefly. [FOOBAR] We're about ready to reconvene with Mr. Bodziak and conclude his testimony. [FOOBAR] Yes, your Honor. I have him here.

I haven't had a chance to read them, but counsel already told me what's in them. It is the bottom line that the tape is no longer in existence.
